# Frontend-Band-Project

A static (front-end only) website for a band

The band would like to use the site to showcase their music and publicise their availability to perform at events such as weddings and Christmas parties
 
## UX
 
Use this section to provide insight into your UX process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:
- As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.

This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included in the project itself (in an separate directory), or just hosted elsewhere online and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser.

User Stories
Existing long term fans of the Monkees and Brand New Fans who have just heard the Monkees and want to learn more.

New and Existing Fans

As a fan of the Monkees I should be quickly find out about any recent news or developments.
As a fan I should be able to listen to my favourite Monkees Tracks on the site.
As a fan I should be able to watch my favourite Monkees Music Videos on the site.
As a fan of the Monkees I should be able to contact them or their staff.
As a fan I should be able to view photos of the band.


As a new Monkees fan I should be able to find out about the monkees, who they are, their history etc.
As a new fan I should be able to use the site to find the band and the band members social media pages.

Scope
Using the user the above user storys and he project brief I identified the follwoing requirements:

Functional Requirements
The Project must be a series of static webpages with multiple sections
The webpages must work in a range of browsers and be responsive
Each of the pages of the site should be accessible from the others.
The project will need to be able to play a range of different media.

Non-Functional Requirements
The site should be intuitive to use
The site should be eye-catching and elegant

Content Requirements
The project will need to contain videos, audio clips, text and images

## Features

Responsive (mobile first)
Fixed top navigation bar
Clear sections
Social links and Email

### Existing Features
- Feature 1 - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z
- ...

Semantic HTML: All pages have been written with semantic HTML in mind.

### Features Left to Implement
- Another feature idea

## Technologies Used

In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

- [JQuery](https://jquery.com)
    - The project uses **JQuery** to simplify DOM manipulation.


## Testing

All code used on the site has been tested to ensure everything is working as expected
Site viewed and tested in the following browsers: Google Chrome, Opera, Microsoft Edge, Mozilla Firefox
The "theQuotes" section (quotes.js) was tested with Jasmine (jasmine.js and jasmine.html)

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
- Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
- Different configuration files?
- Separate git branch?

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
