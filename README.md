# Frontend-Band-Project

A static responsive frontend website based on the music group the monkees.

The band is a 1960â€™s rock band and have around 50 years experience of performing live at numerous events around the world. 

Their primary target audiences are their fans and potential fans who wish to use the site to see and hear clips from their back catalog, and any new material as it becomes available.
Also, the band would like to use the site to showcase their music and publicise their availability to perform at events such as weddings and Christmas parties.
 
## UX

My goal in the design was to make it as easy as possible to access information on the site

New and Existing Fans should 

be able to quickly find out about any recent news or developments. 
be able to listen to their favourite Monkees Tracks on the site. 
be able to watch their favourite Monkees Music Videos on the site. 
be able to contact them or their staff. 
be able to view photos of the band.

As a new Monkees fan I should be able to find out about the monkees, who they are, their history etc. As a new fan I should be able to use the site to find the band and the band members social media pages.
